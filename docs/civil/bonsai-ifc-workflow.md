# Bonsai / IFC4.3 Civil Workflow

Status: implemented design-reference workflow  
Baseline: Bonsai 0.8.5, Blender 5.2, IfcOpenShell 0.8.5, IFC4.3

## Decision

Bonsai is better suited than FreeCAD alone for the federated civil BIM part of
OpenSourceRail: native IFC authoring, rail-domain object classification,
property and quantity inspection, drawing/coordination work, and construction
sequence review. It is not currently a better source for deterministic railway
alignment engineering. The OSR alignment engine and parametric civil catalogue
therefore remain authoritative; Bonsai receives a generated IFC4.3 model and
must not silently override its route or engineering rules.

| Information | Authority | Bonsai role |
|---|---|---|
| Horizontal/vertical alignment, transitions, cant and rule checks | OSR-ALN plus accepted survey/GIS inputs | Inspect the exported `IfcAlignment` reference and coordinate issues |
| Pier, girder, trackform, platform and canopy parameters | `mechanical-py/src/osr_mech/` | Federate, classify, inspect, annotate and develop deployment detail against stable IDs |
| Structural capacity, reinforcement, bearings, foundations and temporary works | Reviewed analysis decks and engineer-released drawings | Coordinate released results; never infer approval from visible geometry |
| IFC object hierarchy, property sets, quantities and 4D task links | Generated IFC checked by IfcOpenShell | Native GUI authoring/review environment |
| Revision identity | City Studio content hash and Git revision | Carry revision and source hashes in IFC properties and the saved Blender scene |

This boundary reflects current upstream limitations: Bonsai's road/rail guide
describes its PI CSV alignment import as a temporary stop-gap, while the
IfcOpenShell alignment API is still under development and explicitly does not
select engineering design parameters.

## Generate and review

Check the installed stack:

```bash
scripts/bonsai-civil.sh --check
```

Generate deterministic IFC and JSON evidence without opening Blender:

```bash
scripts/bonsai-civil.sh --generate
```

Generate, import through Bonsai, save a native review scene, and render it:

```bash
scripts/bonsai-civil.sh --render
```

Render the normalized construction sequence as MP4 as well:

```bash
scripts/bonsai-civil.sh --animate
```

To bind the federation to a City Studio line, use the **Generate Bonsai civil
IFC4.3** job in the engineering hub. The adapter converts the selected line to
the local engineering frame and supplies that immutable reference axis to the
same exporter.

Outputs are written beneath `build/engineering/bonsai-civil/`:

- `civil-coordination.ifc` — native IFC4.3 model;
- `civil-coordination.index.json` — object-aware browser index and authority boundary;
- `civil-construction-sequence.json` — tasks, dates, QA holds and product assignments;
- `civil-coordination.validation.json` — reopen checks and exact IFC hash;
- `civil-coordination.blend` — Bonsai scene retaining IFC links and the animation timeline;
- `civil-coordination.png` and optional MP4 — reproducible visual review artifacts.

## Model content

The current reference federation contains 82 stable assets organised below an
`IfcRailway` and four `IfcRailwayPart` containers: track, substructure,
above-track systems, and lineside/clearance. Civil objects use IFC4.3 types
including `IfcRail`, `IfcBeam`, `IfcColumn`, `IfcSlab`, `IfcRoof`, and an
`IfcAlignment` reference. Each object carries:

- stable OSR asset ID and class;
- canonical source and source hash;
- revision ID and lifecycle status;
- inspectable coordination dimensions and source net volume;
- explicit detail mode when a complex assembly is represented by its review envelope.

Sixteen track, station, and viaduct tasks are embedded in an
`IfcWorkSchedule`. Final installation tasks are linked to their output products
for Bonsai 4D visualization; predecessors, planning durations, QA holds, and
required evidence remain in the companion sequence index.

## Engineering release boundary

The generated model is deliberately labelled **design-reference / not for
construction**. Its nine current gates check interface geometry such as
rail/platform datums, clearance gaps, pier bearing top to girder soffit, and
station/viaduct track-support continuity. It does not release geotechnical
parameters, reinforcement, prestress, bearing schedules, seismic restraints,
drainage capacity, construction loads, or local-code compliance. Those remain
deployment analyses and competent-engineer decisions linked back into IFC only
after review.
