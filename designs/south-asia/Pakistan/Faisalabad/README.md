# Faisalabad — Urban Rail Network

**Country:** PK · **Population:** 3,556,000

Auto-planned by the OpenSourceRail design pipeline: [`osr_geo`](../../../../design-py/src/osr_geo/) rasterises Overpass-verified OpenStreetMap features (arterial road graph, buildings, water, protected land, demand-anchor POIs) onto a 20 m cost / demand / buildability grid; [`osr-design`](../../../../crates/osr-design/) (rust) runs a demand-rewarded Dijkstra on that grid to synthesise corridors, places stations against the demand surface, and classifies every segment (at-grade / elevated / bridge — no tunnels per [RFC 0011](../../../../docs/rfcs/0011-civil-infrastructure-design-standard.md)). Population, country, and bbox are read from the canonical city catalog at [`lib/city-batches/world-sample.toml`](../../../../lib/city-batches/world-sample.toml).

## Network map

## Rolling stock

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Consist | 6-car, 138 m |
| Max speed | 90 km/h |
| Onboard battery | 720 kWh per trainset |
| Nominal capacity | 900 pax (seated + standing, `metro-6car` per RFC 0008 §1) |

## Ridership capacity

- **Per-train capacity:** 900 passengers (`metro-6car`)
- **Peak frequency:** 12 trains/hour/direction (5-min headway)
- **Peak capacity per line per direction:** 900 × 12 = **10,800 pphpd**
- **Network peak throughput (all lines, both directions):** 5 lines × 2 directions × 10,800 = **108,000 passengers/hour**
- **Daily theoretical capacity (peak × 10):** ≈ **1,080,000 passenger-trips/day**
- **Practical daily ridership estimate** (10–15 % of catchment): ≈ **184,200 – 276,301 trips/day**

## Catchment

- City population: **3,556,000**
- Anchor-weighted coverage: 51.8%
- Catchment population: **≈ 1,842,008** (within ~800 m walk of a station)

## Energy infrastructure (solar + battery)

On-site trackside + depot PV and battery storage. Per-tier sizing (from [`../../../../lib/templates/energy-sites.toml`](../../../../lib/templates/energy-sites.toml)):

| Tier | Sites | PV each | Battery each |
|---|---|---|---|
| Depot-Main | 1 | 5000 kW | 40000 kWh |
| Interchange | 19 | 500 kW | 3000 kWh |
| Major | 38 | 400 kW | 2500 kWh |
| Standard | 27 | 300 kW | 2000 kWh |
| Terminal | 7 | 500 kW | 3000 kWh |
| **Total installed** | **92** | **41,300 kW** | **267,000 kWh** |

Aggregate station-rail charging power: **36,500 kW**. Trains opportunity-charge during station dwell per RFC 0002; onboard 720 kWh battery covers running.

## CAPEX (planning grade)

All figures come from the `[costs]` block in `design.toml` — emitted by the `osr-design` Rust planner per RFC 0011 §9. **OSR-discipline unit costs**: prefab portal-frame canopies (no bespoke architectural cladding), at-grade depots without overhead bridge cranes, commodity Na-ion cells + tier-2 PMSM motors + DIY SiC inverters in rolling stock, open-source CBTC on commodity SBCs (no proprietary signalling vendor), no overhead catenary, and self-EPC overhead. Conventional metro budgets land 2–3× higher because of the line items OSR has architected away. `country-costs.toml` applies the per-country labour/material multiplier downstream.

### Civil works

| Bucket | Value |
|---|---|
| At-grade (148.0 km @ €3.5 M/km) | €518 M |
| Elevated (17.2 km @ €18 M/km) | €309 M |
| Elevated-interchange premium (9 sites @ €20 M) | €180 M |
| **Civil subtotal** | **€1.01 bn** |

### Stations

Prefab portal-frame canopy + factory-bonded PV sandwich panel (RFC 0010 §3, ~11 t / 13-bay canopy delivered on two lorries, 3–5 day erection). Precast L-unit platform edge. Vertical circulation per archetype.

| `main-heavy` | 1 | €25 M | €25 M |
| `layup-minimal` | 7 | €3.0 M | €21 M |
| **Depots subtotal** | | | **€46 M** |

### Rolling stock

Per-trainset BOM at OSR-discipline pricing: **onboard** Na-ion traction battery (~$80/kWh, RFC 0021 §3 — distinct from the trackside stationary battery in the *Systems* section below), tier-2 PMSM motors + SiC inverters (RFC 0022 §10, RFC 0008 §3.2), DIY safety electronics (~$5 680/trainset, RFC 0019), aluminium-extrusion or steel space-frame body. Motors and onboard batteries appear here ONLY — never re-billed elsewhere in the cost stack.

| Item | Count | Unit | Subtotal |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metro-6car` (revenue + spare + cold reserve) | 137 | €4.5 M | €616 M |

### Systems

| Item | Basis | Subtotal |
|---|---|---|
| Signalling (open-source CBTC on commodity SBCs, RFC 0019) | 166.0 km × €0.4 M/km | €66 M |
| Traction power (**trackside** stationary PV + Na-ion + grid-tie at every station, no OCS, RFC 0002 §6) | 166.0 km × €0.8 M/km | €132 M |
| EPC integration + project management (7%) | on subtotal | €149 M |

### Total

| Bucket | Value |
|---|---|
| Civil works | €1.01 bn |
| Stations | €261 M |
| Depots | €46 M |
| Rolling stock | €616 M |
| Signalling + power | €198 M |

| Per-route-km | €14 M / km |
| Per-capita (city pop) | €641 / person |

## Funding & affordability

Planning-grade financing model anchored to country financial parameters from [`lib/templates/country-finance.toml`](../../../../lib/templates/country-finance.toml). Pure function of the [costs] block above + the country code — regenerate by re-running `scripts/regenerate-city.sh faisalabad`.

### CAPEX funding stack

| Tranche | Share | Principal | Rate | Tenor | Annual debt service (post-grace) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multilateral concessional loan (IBRD / AfDB / ADB class) | 60% | €1.37 bn | 4.0% | 30 y, 7 y grace | €92 M / yr |
| Sovereign bonds (10-y benchmark + project) | 25% | €570 M | 16.5% | 30 y, 7 y grace | €97 M / yr |
| Government equity (no debt service) | 15% | €342 M | — | — | — |
| **Total** | **100%** | **€2.28 bn** | | | **€189 M / yr** |

### Annual OPEX (steady state)

| Component | Basis | Annual cost |
|---|---|---|
| Rolling-stock maintenance | 4 % of rolling-stock CAPEX | €25 M |
| Civil + station + depot maintenance | 2 % of fixed-asset CAPEX | €26 M |
| Signalling + comms maintenance | 5 % of signalling CAPEX | €3.3 M |
| Traction energy (575.1 GWh / yr) | trackside PV + Na-ion (RFC 0002) — **self-generated, €0 / yr** | €0 k |
| Labour (1,008 FTE) | ~6 FTE/route-km + 12 admin core × country median × 12 × engineer-premium 1.4 | €2.6 M |
| **OPEX subtotal** | | **€57 M / yr** |

_Annual fleet utilisation: 122 revenue trainsets × 20.5 h/day × 365 d/yr × 35 km/h commercial × 75% revenue factor = 24.0 M train-km / yr (~196 k km / trainset / yr)._

### Ticket pricing anchored to median income

Country median monthly income: **$165 USD** (per [`lib/templates/country-finance.toml`](../../../../lib/templates/country-finance.toml)). Target affordability: monthly unlimited pass at 5 % of median income → single-trip price set by the 30:1 pass / trip ratio used by every operator in the affordability literature (STIB, Delhi Metro, Cairo Metro).

| Product | Price target |
|---|---|
| Single-trip fare | €0.25 (~$0.28 USD) |
| Day pass (3 trips) | €0.65 (15 % bulk discount) |
| Monthly unlimited pass | €7.59 (~5 % of median monthly income) |
| Annual pass | €83.49 (10 × monthly = ~1 free month) |

### Farebox & operating subsidy

Practical-ridership bracket = 5–10 % of urban population × 365 service-days. At the affordability-anchored fare:

| | Low scenario | High scenario |
|---|---|---|
| Annual paid trips | 64.9 M | 129.8 M |
| Farebox revenue | €16 M / yr | €33 M / yr |
| Farebox / OPEX recovery | 29% | 58% |
| Country policy-target recovery (diagnostic) | 45% | 45% |
| Operating shortfall (gov subsidy required) | €40 M / yr | €24 M / yr |
| **Total annual government burden** (debt service + OPEX shortfall) | **€229 M / yr** | **€213 M / yr** |

**Caveats:** The funding-stack 60/25/15 split, the 5 % income-share affordability target, and the 5–10 % daily-pax bracket are project-level defaults. Real deployments will negotiate the share with the financing institutions and will tune fares iteratively from boarding data. Treat the numbers above as a first-iteration sanity check, not as a bid-ready financial close.
